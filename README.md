# MikroTik-Scripts
Various scripts for MikroTik routers

I tested scripts on hAP lite (RB941-2nD) but with a bit effort it should works on others routers. 

Quick description of scripts:

- AutoBackUp - this script make system (configuration) backup to internal storage
- AutoBackFTP - this script make system (configuration) backup to FTP server
- AutoUpgrade - this script check if updates are availabe. Make backup and upgrade router. (Choose which type of backup it should be performing)
- PPPOE monitor - this script monitor all PPPoE interface (connection) and try to reset or reconnect if needed
- PPPOE restart - this script restart all enabled PPPoE interfaces 
- Wifi monitor - this script disconnect clients with too weak signal after desired pre-test time
